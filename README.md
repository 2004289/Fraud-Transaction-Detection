# Fraud-Transaction-Detection

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent financial transactions. The dataset is analyzed for patterns, preprocessed for model readiness, and several algorithms are trained and evaluated to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Objectives
Load and explore financial transaction data.

Handle missing values and outliers.

Identify class imbalance and perform resampling if needed.

Select important features.

Train machine learning models for classification.

Evaluate model accuracy using standard metrics.
